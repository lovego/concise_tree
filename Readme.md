Only used for static tree, that means tree structure is frozed at compile time.

## Feature
- A tree is constructed from a struct type, all need to do is define a struct.
  No struct value assignment is required, so you don't need to write every field name twice.
- All tree nodes are defined by struct fields. So node reference is ensured right at compile time.
- No intermediate "Children" fields. So tree definition and node reference are more concise.
- `concise_tree.Setup()` set up code, name and description of all tree nodes automatically.
  Code is generated by concating field names of `ancestor nodes and self node` by "." ;
  Name is generated from struct field's `name` tag;
  Description is generated from struct field's `desc` tag.
- Convert a concise tree to a normal tree with `Children` field in slice form.

## Install
